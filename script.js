/*
2 - Robot Efficiency (07/25/2022)
Can you write a robot that finishes the delivery task faster than goalOrientedRobot? If you observe that robotâ€™s behavior, what obviously stupid things does it do? How could those be improved?
If you solved the previous exercise, you might want to use your compareRobots function to verify whether you improved the robot.

    /*
     * This robot is an optimized version of the goalOrientedRobot as it improves 
     * in certain key areas.
     *
     * The goal oriented robot only finds the shortest route for the topmost parcel in
     * the stack (parcel[0]) which means it only looks for a short term solution and might
     * miss out another prospective routes which are better than the one mentioned above.
     *
     * Hence, to resolve this shortcoming, `optimizedRobot` finds the shortest routes to each
     * of the `parcels` from a given `place` and then, selects the one which satisfies the 
     * following criteria:
     *
     * 1. It priortizes parcel pickups over deliveries. It only starts creating routes with the
     * goal of delivering parcels when all the parcels have been picked up.
     *
     * 2. Minimum number of intermediate stops/places. If two routes having the same action type
     * either pickup or delivery are given, the robot will select the route with the lesser amount
     * of intermediate stops.
